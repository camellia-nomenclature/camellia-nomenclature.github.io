SPECIES RETICULATA AND HYBRIDS WITH RETICULATA PARENTAGE The predominant opinion is that Reticulata is not a distinct species, but is a hybrid of other species, probably largely Pitardii (which also is believed to be a hybrid) fractionally combined with Japonica. The Yunnan Reticulatas, which were imported into the United States from China in 1948 by Ralph S. Peer of Hollywood, California and Descanso Gardens of La Canada, generally have been listed as Reticulata and their seedlings listed as Reticulata Hybrids. It is the opinion of many that such cultivars represent garden forms of Reticulata, some Pitardii Variety Yunnanica, and some hybrid crosses of both. Many such cultivars are over three hundred years old. Therefore, it is believed advisable to list Reticulatas and Hybrids with Reticulata Parentage in this same section. Cultivars imported directly to the United States from China during the 40's, 50's, 60's and 80's have been marked with an asterisk (*).","image":null,"acs_url":null}]
